## Background

This BASIC *basal/0* takes it inspiration from Tiny BASIC.
But Tiny BASIC has a very interesting history of its own.


One interesting controversy was between the computer famous
Bill Gates and what Gates understood as piracy of Micro-Softs’
BASIC by hobbyists in the early days of microcomputing.
This might have been a point in history where events highlighted
larger changes in the software industry. On one hand software
started to be more of a product of its own, protected by the
manufacturer/seller by copyright or even patent, but also often
by some intentional obfuscation with the code. On the other hand
the source code wasn’t a separate issue so much when software
was tied to the machines they were made for, when it was the
same company that sold them both. Later when machines themselves
were copied and compatible with the competitors, software became
more of a protected commodity. On another hand again, people
learned from just even reading the source code of others. The
source code itself could improve when there were more people
involved, it could be extended. This was also what some in the
business understood, when they wanted feedback from customers
when they altered things in the delivered code.

In the early days of microcomputing, hobbyists made their own
computers to a large extent themselves. There could be e.g.
schematic for circuits published in a magazine, but then you
had to buy, solder, etch boards, etc. to manufacture the computer.
A small industry of computer kits emerged, some even prefabricated
to the degree you could buy the kit and plug in an old teletype
for keyboard, and maybe some perforated paper tape for storage
of programs and data, or at a cassette tape.

But programs were hard to get when you finally had the machine.
As hobbyists a need for sharing, buying and selling software arised,
so computer clubs were one of the forums. In a generous atmosphere
giving and taking could be done without money in between, not always,
but sometimes. Magazines and books had listings of code that could
be entered and run on the computer. But also as software has the
characteristic of being copied without losing quality (as in the
case of music and cassette tapes e.g.), software could be distributed
without the consent of the author or authors. This could understandably
be understood as some kind of piracy of the author. In this case the
intention was that software was only to be sold, not given away. But
due to different reasons copies of originally sold software were
distributed among enthusiasts. There reason could be that it was too
expensive to buy, if you could not afford it. It could be that you
only wanted to explore software you didn’t really need for a long
time, or had no further use for. It could also be because you didn’t
want to pay, when you could get it for free (or “free”).


## Tiny BASIC

Tiny Basic, some comments on code, and the "vm".
Tiny Basic as a start of the open source movement,
and why it started: as a reply to Bill Gates intensions
and the problem with piracy (or "piracy").
