# Virtual Machines

Virtual machines samples[^1]. A collection of virtual machines to teach or understand some
ideas and inner workings of virtual machines. They are solely intended for show of principles,
and not for uses in any other way.

[^1]: My best inspiration for the code of simple machines here comes from Bartosz Sypytowski:
https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/simple-virtual-machine/ from whom I derived basically the code,
even though some bugs were corrected and many more additions has been made.

My interest in virtual machines started long time ago, first with USCD Pascal on the Apple II
...

*NOTE: The term "virtual machine" can often be replaced by "emulator", "interpreter" etc. and
perhaps should not be restricted or qualified too much. The idea of an abstraction that separates
the underlying mechanics from the levels above is what should be observed, not a deepend confusion
of concepts which already are ambigious and not very well definied.*

## *From virtual machines to compilers*

### 1. vm1

We start off with a simple virtual stack machine. To not be confused to much, it has been simplified
in many ways. There is no error checking, no warnings, you have to compile the machine if you only
slightly change the program, etc. The idea is to grasp what happends inside the virtual machine
and use code as the main instructive part.
