# Virtual Machines

Virtual machines samples[^1]. A collection of virtual machines to teach or understand some
ideas and inner workings of virtual machines. They are solely intended for show of principles,
and not for uses in any other way.

[^1]: My best inspiration for the code of simple machines here comes from Bartosz Sypytowski:
https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/simple-virtual-machine/ from whom I derived basically the code,
even though some bugs were corrected and many more additions has been made.

My interest in virtual machines started long time ago, first with USCD Pascal on the Apple II
