# Virtual Machines

*A very simple virtual machine implemented as a stack machine.*[^stackmachine]

As an example: Push two numbers on the stack. Each at a time.
Then add the two numbers. Place the result back on the stack. Take
the value of the top of stack. Then print this sum. Halt.

[^stackmachine]: See e.g. https://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~prabhas//teaching/ca/stack.htm
or (at present not very well organized) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine.

It might look odd with first pushing two numbers on stack then
have an operation on them after. Instead of "3 + 4" most of us
use daily, we could have written this expression as "+ 3 4".
Here the add sign is taken before the operands. This is actually
very ingenious.[^1] We could get rid of parentheses, as the notation
easily allows for priorities of operations, without a previous
convention for priorities. In this case we however reverse the
notation such that the operand comes last "3 4 +".
This is called RPN.

[^1]: See https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lukasiewicz/polish-notation.html.
This is actually a reference to the origin in logic, esp. propositional
logic. But from a formal standpoint it works equally well with simple
aritmetical expressions with '+', '-', '*' and '/' instead of
logical connectives as e.g. '&', '.', '->' or as with ≈Åukasiewicz
'C', 'K', 'A' etc.

You might already be familiar with RPN or "reverse polish notation"
which has been used by Hewlett Packard with their calculators.
Or you might have experience with some programming language
(e.g. FORTH) which uses this notation.



## vm1

A representation of a sample program is hard coded into `vm1.c`:

```c
int program[] = {
     SET, 33,
     SET, 44,
     ADD,
     PRINT,
     HALT
};
```

```assembly
   SET, 33,        <- store 33 on the stack, 33 on the top
   SET, 44,        <- next, store 44 on the stack, top now 44
   ADD,            <- add the two numbers on the stack, 33 + 44 = 77, and put the result on stack
   PRINT,          <- take what is on the stack and print (77)
   HALT            <- halt the program
```

Everything in the program is represented as integers (positive integers).
For instance `SET` is internally represented by a number (5), `ADD` is
represented by another number (2), and so on. A switch statement selects
each "instruction" and executes the corresponding routine.

```c
...
case SET:
     v = nextcode(vm);
     push(vm, v);
     break;
...
```

The instruction for storing numbers on the stack is `SET`. When executed,
the next instruction in line (a number), will be put on stack `push(vm, v)`
where *vm* represents the main structure for the virtual machine (program
counter, stack pointer ...) and *v* is the value to be put on the stack.

In `vm1.c` the important functions are:
- `VM* newVM(int* code, int pc)` which allocates vm, struct for the stack, code array, program counter (pc) and stack pointer (sp). 
- `void freeVM(VM* vm)` deallocates vm.
- `int pop(VM* vm)` moves the pointer (sp) at the array for the stack to pop a value, stack impl. here as a fixed array.
- `void push(VM* vm, int v)` push a value on stack.
- `int nextcode(VM* vm)` move the pointer (pc) at the array to the next code in line. Can be value or operation depending on previous code. 
- `run(VM* vm)` the "processor". Picks a code from the array, and finds out what the operation will do, and execute on it.

## run

Compile with gcc installed, and then run:

```sh
> gcc vm1.c
> ./a.out
```

Or, if not gcc installed:

```sh
> cc vm1.c -o vm1
> ./vm1
```

You should be able to see what 33 + 44 is ... (hint 77)


## portability

One of the many praised features of virtual machines is enabling *portability of code*.
You can try another version of the virtual machine in "alternate-vm.html", which you
can run in your browser. Copy to the desktop and double-click, check through the developer
option in your browser the output from "console.log". (Another stripped and rudimentary
implementation is in "alternate-vm.py", which you can run if Python >3.10 is installed.)
You will notice the program is the same in *principle* (as the opcodes can also be) so we only
implement a new virtual machine each time we would like to run the program on another
system, operating system, hardware, etc. *The code for the program then can remain the same.*
Sun Microsystems Inc., the company originally behind the programming language Java,
once had a slogan: "Write Once, Run Anywhere,"[^any] that kind of illustrates that idea.
