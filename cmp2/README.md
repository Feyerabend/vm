# Virtual machines

Parsing programs as text. Sample with educational language PL/0.

## cmp2

We'll now make a jump from the *semantics* (abstractions) to *syntax* of programs. In this case we will chose the syntax
from the famous educational PL/0 language by Niklaus Wirth which has been around for many years.[^1] Maybe you will find
it very close resemblance to Pascal, which is no surprise, as Wirth also is behind Pascal, but PL/0 is much more limited.

## run

```
var x, squ, answer;

procedure square;
begin
   squ := x * x
end;

begin
   x := 1;
   while x <= 10 do
   begin
      call square;
      answer := squ;
      x := x + 1
   end
end.
```

The above program calculates square of x, xÂ² or (x * x) of a given number. Right now there is no way to print the
result, but also there is no semantics at all. So you will not be able to run the program. It is for you to inspect
the syntactical structures, and what parsing does from the side of a text representation of simple program.

There is a wikipage which also gives part implementation of the syntactical analysis for PL/0:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser as an example of recursive decent parsing.

What is lacking is a scanner that checks for tokens in a stream, and gives the parser each "comprehensive" element
here added as `scan.c` and `scan.h`.

To run `sample1.pas` compile the parser (and scanner):

```
> make clean
> make par1
```

Then run the parser:

```
> ./par1 < sample1.pas
```

This will give a long list of parsed elements. There are some very poor error checking and warnings. But unless
you are wery well acquainted with the program you test, you will probably not guess correctly what the problem
(syntax error) will be or what is indicated from the parsing. Again, this is *not* how parsers should be written,
but some code that will hopwfully show what parsing in a very general way looks like.
At this stage our interest is only with the *syntax* and not if the program is correct in any other way.
