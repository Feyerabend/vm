# Virtual Machines

## garbage collection

So far we have ignored in principal how memory or memory management
for the VM should or could look like. Certainly the *stack* is a
memory allocation of sort, but we keep it close to the stack machine,
so it should not exceed either a predetermied size or too much allocated
space (no infinite memory) allocating or deallocating memory with
function calls, calculations on the stack, etc.

But there is a concern considering the 'heap'. It can be difficult
to determine at compile time how much of memory should be allocated.
Thus the *heap* is used for objects whose lifetime and size cannot be
determined at compile time.

In Python the build-in garbage collector takes care of any
memory concerns. But in C we have to check for ourselves
the memory required. So far the easiest solution is to
allocate memory at the start, and crash when there is nothing left.
This isn't ideal in a real scenario. One way of handling memory
in C is also to use garbage collection, collected at suitable places,
in the program.

In C, functions like `malloc` (memory allocation) and `free`
(deallocation) are used to manage memory on the heap. When you
allocate memory using `malloc`, a block of memory is reserved
on the heap, and you receive a pointer to that memory. When
you are done using that memory, you must manually release
it using `free` to avoid memory leaks.
Over time, as memory is allocated and deallocated, the heap can
become very *fragmented*, which can lead to inefficient use of
memory and, in some cases, allocation failures if there
isnâ€™t a large enough contiguous block available.

Memory management in a VM can involve several critical aspects.
They can including allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection.
For C this poses additional challenges, as C
does not automatically reclaim unused memory, leading to
potential memory leaks and crashes if not managed correctly.

A sample of a very simple illustration of this can be seen in
`gc.c`. The provided code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation
of a mark-and-sweep garbage collector. It manages a heap of
`Object` instances, performs garbage collection when necessary,
and provides utility functions to create and list objects.
This approach can be extended and adapted for various
applications in a virtual machine.


### memory management considerations in C

a.) *Static vs. dynamic allocation*
   - *Static*. Memory is allocated at compile-time. While this
   is straightforward, it limits flexibility and can waste memory
   if the allocation size is not well-calibrated.
   - *Dynamic*. Memory is allocated at runtime using functions
   like `malloc` and `free`. This is more flexible but requires
   careful management to avoid leaks and fragmentation.

b.) *Constraints and safety*
   - *Pre-allocated heap*. Allocating a fixed-size heap and crashing
   when it is full, as in the previously provided example, is simple
   but not ideal. It does not handle scenarios where memory demands
   fluctuate or where memory can be reclaimed dynamically.
   - *Garbage Collection (GC)*. Implementing garbage collection helps
   automatically manage memory by reclaiming unused objects, but it
   introduces overhead and some complexity.


### gc.c

Compile and run:

```shell
> make gc2
> ./gc2
```

The internals:

   ```c
   typedef struct Object {
       int marked;  // mark flag
       struct Object* next;  // a simple linked list ..
   } Object;
   ```
   - `marked`: A flag used during garbage collection to
     indicate if the object is reachable.
   - `next`: A pointer to the next object in a linked list
     (which simulates an object reference).


   ```c
   Object* heap[MAX_OBJECTS];
   int num_objects = 0;
   ```
   - `heap`: An array of pointers to `Object` structures,
      representing the managed heap.
   - `num_objects`: The count of objects currently in the heap.


   ```c
   Object* root = NULL;
   ```
   - A pointer to an `Object` that serves as the point for
   the garbage collection process. Objects reachable from
   `root` are considered *live* (in use).


#### GC functions

Allocates a `new_object` and triggers garbage collection,
if the heap is full:

   ```c
   Object* new_object() {
       if (num_objects >= MAX_OBJECTS) {
           printf("Heap full, running garbage collection...\n");
           mark_and_sweep();
           if (num_objects >= MAX_OBJECTS) {
               printf("Out of memory!\n");
               exit(1);
           }
       }
       Object* obj = (Object*)malloc(sizeof(Object));
       obj->marked = 0;
       obj->next = NULL;
       heap[num_objects++] = obj;
       return obj;
   }
   ```

Recursively marks with `make` all reachable objects,
starting from the given `obj`:

   ```c
   void mark(Object* obj) {
       if (obj == NULL || obj->marked) return;
       obj->marked = 1;
       printf("Marking object at %p\n", (void*)obj);
       if (obj->next) {
           mark(obj->next);
       }
   }
   ```

It `sweep`and thus frees objects that are not marked
as reachable and reorganizes the heap:

   ```c
   void sweep() {
       for (int i = 0; i < num_objects; i++) {
           if (heap[i]->marked) {
               heap[i]->marked = 0;
           } else {
               printf("Sweeping object at %p\n", (void*)heap[i]);
               free(heap[i]);
               heap[i] = heap[--num_objects];
               i--; // adjust index as object get lost
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Main GC, `mark_and_sweep`:

   ```c
   void mark_and_sweep() {
       mark_all();
       sweep();
   }
   ```


### examples of usage

In a VM context, the provided garbage collection
implementation can be adapted to manage various
types of objects.

a.) *Objects in a programming language*
   - *Data structures*: The `Object` structure could represent objects
   like *strings*, *arrays*, or *user-defined types* (in a VM).
   - *Memory management*: The GC can automatically reclaim memory for
   objects that are no longer reachable, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

b.) *VM internals*
   - *Stack frames*: Objects could represent stack frames or other
   internal data structures.
   - *Instruction state*: The linked list could represent a sequence
   of instructions or state information that needs to be managed.



### gc2.c

```shell
> make gc2
> ./gc2
```

The `gc2.c`have some slight improvements over `gc.c`.
Those are in object management thriugh the *reference counting*,
and *pools*.
Besides addition to mark-and-sweep, implementing reference
counting can help manage objects (with circular references)
more effectively.
For frequently allocated and deallocated objects of the same
size (here examplified with '10'), using memory pools can reduce
fragmentation and improve performance.

Some improvements of providing *errors*, thus improving robustness
by handling memory allocation failures gracefully and providing
mechanisms for easier recovery or scaling.

Implementing some "debugging" features by printing statements
to track memory usage and identify potential leaks or performance
bottlenecks.

Future enhancements could involve implementing memory
pools for common object sizes and adding profiling
tools to monitor memory usage.
