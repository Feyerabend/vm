# Background

## Xerox Parc[^parc]

In the early 1970s, Xerox Corporation embarked on an ambitious
project to create a research center that would push the
boundaries of technology far beyond their core copier business.
This vision led to the establishment of the
*Palo Alto Research Center*, commonly known as *PARC*, in 1970.

One of PARC’s most notable early achievements was the development
of the *Alto* computer in 1973. It featured a graphical user 
interface (GUI), which was a revolutionary concept at the time,
allowing users to interact with the computer using *windows*,
*icons*, and *menus*, and navigate with a *mouse*. Although
the Alto was never sold commercially, it profoundly influenced
the design of future personal computers (e.g. the future Macintosh
and Windows operating systems).

Parallel to the development of the Alto, PARC invented *Ethernet*,
a networking technology that allowed multiple computers to
communicate over a shared coaxial cable. This innovation,
developed in 1973, laid the groundwork for local area networks
(LANs), which became the backbone of modern computer networking.

Alan Kay, another visionary at PARC, led the development of
*Smalltalk*, an object-oriented programming language. Beginning
in the early 1970s, Smalltalk introduced (with other languages)
a new way of thinking about software design by using objects
to represent both data and behavior.

In the realm of text editing, Charles Simonyi at PARC developed
the Bravo text editor, which was one of the first applications
to use the *WYSIWYG* (What You See Is What You Get) principle.
This meant that what users saw on their screen was exactly how
the document would appear when printed. Bravo, developed in the
mid-1970s, set the standard for modern word processors and paved
the way for software like the ubiquitous Microsoft Word.

### Laser printers

While PARC was pioneering these revolutionary computing technologies,
Gary Starkweather was working on adapting laser technology for
printing. Transferring from Xerox’s Rochester facility to PARC
in 1971, Starkweather began developing what would become the
laser printer. By 1972, he had created a working prototype, and
this breakthrough led to the commercialization of laser printing
technology. In 1977, Xerox released the 9700 Electronic Printing
System, capable of printing at a remarkable speed of 120 pages
per minute with the resolution of 300 dpi. This innovation
transformed the printing industry, making high-speed, high-quality
printing accessible for office automation and desktop
publishing.[^printer]

### Software for printing: InterPress[^interpress]

While employed at PARC, John Warnock and Charles Geschke worked
on a project called *Interpress*. It was designed to precisely
describe the layout and contents of printed pages, making it a
precursor to *PostScript*. Interpress aimed to facilitate
high-quality printing by providing a detailed and
*device-independent specification of documents*.
Xerox did not fully capitalize on its potential, or maybe
didn't saw larger markets where it could be used.

## Adobe Systems, PostScript and DTP

In 1982, Warnock and Geschke, two researchers from PARC,
left Xerox to found Adobe Systems. Recognizing the need for
such a technology, they decided to develop a new, more versatile
page description language, which they named *PostScript*.
PostScript was designed to be beside device-independent
it could describe text, images, and graphics on any printer or
display device. It used much of the same concept of a
stack-based programming language, enabling precise control
over the rendering of documents.

The introduction of PostScript in 1984 revolutionized the printing
and publishing industries. It allowed for the creation of complex,
high-quality documents with precise layouts that could be printed
exactly as they appeared on the screen. PostScript's capabilities
included advanced typography, graphics, and image handling, making
it an ideal choice for professional publishing.

### Apple & Adobe

The relationship between Xerox PARC's innovations and PostScript
became even more significant through Adobe's partnership with
[Apple](APPLE.md). In 1985, Apple launched the LaserWriter, the
first PostScript-based laser printer, which worked seamlessly
with the Macintosh computer. This collaboration was instrumental
in the rise of desktop publishing (DTP), empowering individuals
and small businesses to produce professional-quality printed
materials without needing expensive typesetting equipment.

One more element was required for the DTP revolution to take off:
*PageMaker*.[^pagemaker] PageMaker, developed by Aldus
Corporation[^aldus] and released in 1985, was one of the
first desktop publishing software applications.
It revolutionized the publishing industry by enabling users to
create professional-quality documents with flowing text, pictures
and graphics integrated on the same page. PageMaker’s compatibility
with Apple Macintosh and its use of the PostScript page description
language were pivotal in making desktop publishing accessible
to a wider audience.

### Consequences

*"Democratization" of publishing*: These technologies lowered the
barriers to entry in the publishing industry. Small businesses,
magazines, and other publications could now produce high-quality
printed materials without the need for costly prepress services.

*Efficiency in prepress*: The combination of PageMaker and
PostScript-enabled laser printers streamlined the prepress
process. Designers could create, edit, and proof their layouts
on screen, printing them directly from their computers. This
eliminated the need for manual typesetting and paste-up
processes, which were labor-intensive and time-consuming.

*Cost reduction*: By enabling in-house production of professional
documents, businesses could significantly cut costs associated
with outsourcing prepress and printing tasks. This was especially
beneficial for small publishers and corporate marketing departments.

*Productivity*: The ability to see immediate results of
design changes on-screen and print high-quality proofs rapidly
increased productivity. Iterations could be completed much faster
than with traditional methods.

*Desktop Publishing (DTP)*: Much of the synergy between PageMaker,
PostScript, laser printers, and the Macintosh gave rise to
the desktop publishing industry. This revolutionized how
printed materials were produced and led to the development
of new software and hardware designed specifically for this purpose.
